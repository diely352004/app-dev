### **My Favorite Series**

My favorite series would probably be an anime that I came across when I was just watching stuff on **"Animax"**, and that was a series called 
**"Little Battlers Experience"** or more known as **"Danball Senki"**. It was basically a "gunpla" sort of anime, where people had to "build" their own robots
and each robots had their own unique models, and those robots are then remotely controlled by a sort of "flip-phone" controller. What made me like the show was
simply by the premise of "cool looking robots fighting each other" and the animation, especially for the major fight scenes were pretty good given for the time it was made.
My favorite model out of all the ones that I have seen throughout the show would probably be, **"Dot Blastrizer"**.
